# Road-Safety-Application-Using-LIDER-Sensor
In the automotive industry to reduce road fatalities,Active safety features are one of the vital concerns. With the
help of sensing technologies, to avoid collisions and accidents
various safety applications have been integrated into todayâ€™s
autonomous vehicle. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor
is prominent in this area as in recent years it is emerging as
a powerful asset for security system integrators and solutions
providers. This passage mainly focuses on the working principle
of LIDAR sensors, components, and applications on safety system
development. Additionally, the performance of the LIDAR over
different active road safety applications and the algorithm outline
and recognition resultin the real world has been denoted.
